# Reacting

### Building a react profile page with an image gallery, music player, and chessboard. 

[x] ~~create basic profile header with image and "profile" info~~  <br>
[x] ~~create components for color photos and b&w photos~~  <br>
[x] ~~create thumbnails for images and hide full resolution ones~~  <br>
[x] ~~finish code to display full size image when clicked~~  <br>
[x] ~~create gallery for images, may need to make thumbnails smaller so they all exist in one line~~  <br>
[x] ~~use documentation & chat gpt to get basics and play around to understand how it works~~ <br>
[ ] begin work on my own music player component  <br>
 &nbsp; [ ] create basic player <br>
 &nbsp; [ ] add at least two beats to player <br>
 &nbsp; [ ] create functionality for play/pause <br>
 &nbsp; [ ] create next track button <br>
 &nbsp; [ ] ensure current track stops before next track is played <br>
[ ] add in d20 you can click to roll <br>
 &nbsp; [ ] make function for d20 (should be super easy with math random and math round) <br>
 &nbsp; [ ] style function to look like static d20 <br>
 &nbsp; [ ] if possible try to animate image a bit when you click to roll <br>
